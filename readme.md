<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>
Write an http server that uses the Open Weather API that exposes an endpoint that takes in lat/longcoordinates.  This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain,etc), whether it’s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates toeach type), and whether there are any weather alerts going on in that area, with what is going on if thereis currently an active alert.  The API can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api.  The one-call apireturns all of the data while the other apis are piece-mealed sections.  You may also find thehttps://openweathermap.org/faq useful.
